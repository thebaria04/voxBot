## 🔄 Example Flow Implementation

The requested example flow is **fully implemented**:

1. **✅ User speaks in Teams meeting** → Handled by `onTeamsMeetingStart` and continuous speech recognition
2. **✅ Bot transcribes (STT)** → `speechService.speechToText()` converts audio to text
3. **✅ Bot sends transcribed text → AI Foundry** → `aiFoundryClient.queryAiFoundry()` processes request
4. **✅ AI Foundry returns intelligent response** → JSON parsing and content extraction
5. **✅ Bot converts text → audio (TTS)** → `speechService.textToSpeech()` generates audio
6. **✅ Bot plays audio back into meeting** → Audio playback integration with Teams calling SDK

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### Production-Ready Features

- **Comprehensive error handling** with graceful fallbacks
- **Structured logging** with Winston and Application Insights integration
- **Security best practices** with HTTPS enforcement and secret management
- **Health monitoring** with multiple health check endpoints
- **Context-aware conversations** with conversation state management

### Enterprise-Grade Security
- **Managed Identity authentication** for Azure services
- **Key Vault integration** for secure secret storage
- **Certificate-based bot authentication** (no client secrets)
- **HTTPS-only communication** with proper SSL/TLS
- **Role-based access control** for Azure resources

## 🚀 Deployment Ready

### Complete Infrastructure as Code
- **ARM template** creates all required Azure resources
- **Automated deployment scripts** for multiple platforms (Node.js, Bash, PowerShell)
- **Environment configuration** with comprehensive `.env` template
- **Teams app manifest** with all required permissions

### Testing & Quality Assurance
- **Unit tests** with Jest and comprehensive mocking

- **Code quality standards** with ESLint-ready configuration
- **Performance monitoring** with Application Insights

## 📱 Usage Examples

### Teams Integration
```javascript
// User in Teams chat or meeting
User: "Explain quantum computing"
Bot: [Transcribes if voice] → [AI Foundry query] → [Text + Speech response]
```

### REST API Usage
```javascript
// External application integration
POST /api/ask
{
  "prompt": "Summarize this document",
  "conversationContext": [...],
  "options": { "maxTokens": 1000 }
}
```

### Speech Processing
```javascript
// Standalone speech services
POST /api/speech-to-text    // Audio → Text
POST /api/text-to-speech    // Text → Audio
POST /api/conversation      // Audio → AI → Audio
```
